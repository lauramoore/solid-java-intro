# Welcome
This project contains exercises intended for experienced programmers who need to become familiar with the Java ecosystem and tools.  Or with Java developers looking to refresh their Agile developer skills in Test-Driven-Development and Continuous Integration.

_You can always find help on our Daugherty Slack Channel: AgileBootCampHelp_

## Goals for Bootcamp:
* Source Code Management with Git
* Core Java Fundamentals (Object Oriented SOLID design, Collections, File IO)
* Maven for dependency management and build automation
* Test Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit

The Exercises Folder contains a progression of lessons.  you will be building a system of code that can read and parse a CSV file and perform calculations on the data contained.   Each milestone is tagged as a separate commit point in this repo.  

## Setup
You are free to work in any IDE you are comfortable with, keeping in mind that the course instructors will only be able to assist in IDE *they* are comfortable with!

If you are starting our from scratch, instructions for installing all your dependencies are found in 0-SystemSetup.

If you already have Java, Maven and a working IDE 1-ProjectSetup will walk you through steps needed to checkout this project and validate your setup.

At the start I asked you to apply the Single Responsibility principle to your solution,
let's test your learning.  How much code will you need to change in order to:

1. Add to the output percent H/T in the final result
```
H: %d T: %d = f%
```
Where f% is a floating point decimal to 2 digits precision.  For exampl
H: 1 T: 0 = 1.00
H: 3 T: 7 = .30
H: 1 T: 2 = .33

2. Optionally print the cumulative results of each flip.
* Take in a second argument on command line to print cumulative or totals
* If cumulative then output format for each flip.  For example 3 flips could show
```
H: 1 T: 0 = 1.0
H: 2 T: 0 = 1.0
H: 2 T: 1 = .66
```

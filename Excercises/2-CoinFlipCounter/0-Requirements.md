`git checkout coinflipcounter`

We're going to build a simple engine to simulate the flip of a coin,  then count and tabulate the results over a series of flips.

Print results to Console in the following format:  `H: %d T: %d`  where %d will contain the total of each occurrence heads or tails from a total number of flips

For Example: 
* Given 1 Flip you might print `H: 0 T: 1`
* Given 10 Flips you might print `H: 7 T: 3`

Use built in Java functions to randomize the result of each flip.
Use built in Java String formatters to dynamically generate the output with the results.

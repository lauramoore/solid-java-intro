We're going to do something interesting on top of coin flipping. We're going to gamble.

Rules of the Gamble are Simple
Player predicts 5 consecutive tosses: for example: [H][T][H][T][T]
Player wagers by paying a penny per run of 5 tosses
Win $100 dollars if any one toss matches prediction.

For example:
```
Prediction: [H][T][H][T][T]
Wager: 5 runs
Outcome:
[H][T][H][H][T]
[T][T][H][H][T]
[T][H][H][T][T]
[H][T][H][T][T]
[T][T][H][T][T]
```
Player Wins!

To get you started I've setup the Main method to take input as well as a failing Junit Test.

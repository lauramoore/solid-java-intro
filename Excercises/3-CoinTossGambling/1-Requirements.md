We're going to do something interesting on top of coin flipping. We're going to gamble.

Rules of the Gamble are Simple
Player predicts 5 consecutive tosses: for example: [H][T][H][T][T]
Player wagers by paying a penny per run of 5 tosses
Win $100 dollars if any one toss matches prediction.

For example:
```
Prediction: [H][T][H][T][T]
Wager: 5 runs
Outcome:
[H][T][H][H][T]
[T][T][H][H][T]
[T][H][H][T][T]
[H][T][H][T][T]
[T][T][H][T][T]
```
Player Wins!

Checkout branch cointossgamble.  I've started you off with a way to take input from command line, and a Junit Test for prediction to result pattern matching.
